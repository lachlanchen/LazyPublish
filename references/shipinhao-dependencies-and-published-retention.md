# Shipinhao Recovery and Published Staging Retention

## Diagnosed Failures

On 2026-10-09 a valid 2160x3840 recording uploaded and decoded, but the cover
stayed at `生成中`. Browser resource timing showed repeated 30-second timeouts
for Tencent's public `rhino_video.wasm`. The music form also stalled on
`vts.wasm`, leaving its audio upload at zero percent. This was not disk pressure.

The language menu independently had a double-click bug: native `click()` plus
a synthetic click opened then closed the dropdown. Its Japanese option existed.
The selector now clicks once and preserves an open menu across asynchronous
render polls. Live verification selected Japanese and read it back on the next
poll. Do not report missing platform support from a failed selector alone.

WeUI can disable a button with `weui-desktop-btn_disabled` while leaving the
HTML `disabled` property false. Readiness, draft and publish checks must recognize
that class suffix; JavaScript `\bdisabled\b` misses it because underscore is a
word character. The shared video scripts now recognize standalone, hyphen and
underscore disabled-class tokens. Regression:
`python -m unittest tests.test_shipinhao_disabled_buttons -v` (Node, no browser).
An enabled-looking HTML property alone never proves upload/cover readiness.

Shipinhao's current management UI renders the video list in a same-origin
iframe. The shared verifier now collects visible frame content and ignores
CSS/script text in shadow roots; it refreshes a stale management list on retry.
After any publish-click attempt, an uncertain acknowledgment or verification
failure stops the publisher instead of recursively uploading and posting again.
Reconcile the existing post/draft before a scoped recovery. Pre-submission
page failures retain the bounded retry. Regressions:

```sh
python -m unittest tests.test_shipinhao_submission_retry -v
python -m unittest tests.test_publish_verification_frames -v
```

The frame tests use a temporary headless Playwright browser and close it after
the checks. They verify native visible iframe receipts, hidden-frame exclusion,
and that stylesheet text cannot masquerade as a publication receipt.

The shared content-frame click helper previously called both `element.click()`
and a synthetic click, firing the same control twice. It now dispatches one
click and refuses class-disabled controls. The same browser suite verifies the
single-click event count and the disabled-button boundary. This does not make
a click a successful post: the separate native management receipt is required.

## Verified Public Dependency Cache

`browser_asset_cache.py` optionally reads
`~/.cache/autopublish/browser-assets.json` (override with
`AUTOPUBLISH_BROWSER_ASSETS`). A manifest entry contains `url`, `file` and
`sha256`; the file must be beside the manifest, not a symlink. Only the explicit
Tencent public WebAssembly URL families are allowed. Magic bytes and SHA-256
must both match. Fetch the original bytes over verified HTTPS, optionally using
an authorized machine with working access to that CDN. Do not synthesize them,
disable TLS verification, or commit cached binaries.

The cache attaches only during Shipinhao video/music publication, to its existing
dedicated loopback Chrome browser, and supplies the exact vendor bytes. Browser
level Fetch is necessary: worker sessions reject `Fetch.enable`, and page-level
interception misses the worker's downloads. All authenticated
APIs and every other request still use the platform normally. Cover readiness,
form validation and publication verification remain mandatory. The connection
and interception are closed after the publisher exits. Without a manifest the
browser behaves as before.

The live worker appends `_rid` and `_pageUrl` telemetry query parameters. The
cache ignores only those observed keys when matching the pinned static binary;
unknown query keys bypass the cache, and parameter values are not logged.

## Default Cleanup

After a terminal job, `AUTOPUBLISH_CLEAN_PUBLISHED=1` (default) removes confirmed
published **remote staging** media and their uploaded ZIP. Set it to `0` to retain
staging. The queue journal now defaults to `logs/publish-queue.json` under the
runtime data root, preserving job hashes and results across restarts.

- Require the current archive's recorded SHA-256 and a successful result for
  **every requested platform**, including targets from earlier partial batches.
- A successful scoped retry can complete that same immutable archive's batch.
- An acceptance guard blocks cleanup from the beginning of upload validation
  through queue insertion, not merely while a job is already visible as queued.
- Preserve any archive still queued/running, partially failed, ambiguous, in
  test mode, from shared canonical workspace storage, or lacking hash evidence.
- Delete only exact archive-member media whose bytes still match. Keep manual
  files, changed files, metadata, corrected lyrics, subtitles, covers and proofs.
- Never follow symlinks, traverse outside the direct package directory, delete
  browser profiles, or touch original workstation/Nutstore recordings.
- Write a durable checksum/result receipt under
  `transcription_data/.published-receipts/` **before** deletion. A cleanup failure
  does not invalidate publication or trigger another social post.

Review historical candidates without deleting:

```bash
python published_retention.py --journal /runtime/logs/publish-queue.json \
  --root /runtime/transcription_data
```

Use `--apply` only while the publisher is stopped or idle. Unknown older data is
not automatically assumed published. Keep it until its receipts are recovered.
After cleanup, a deliberate republish re-uploads the canonical LazyEdit ZIP;
`reuse_existing=true` alone cannot recover a removed staging archive.

## Music Form Readiness

An enabled submit button and completed proof upload do not prove the audio and
album form are ready. On 2026-10-10, three immediate attempts returned the generic
incomplete-form message; the same retained form later passed all four native
validators and submitted successfully without replacing the song or lyrics.
The exact field that failed during those earlier clicks was not captured.

The publisher now waits for audio/cover upload completion and the site's own
asynchronous form validators. It logs only readiness flags and form names, never
signed upload URLs. Unknown form structure fails closed. After clicking submit,
require the explicit `你的音乐已提交` confirmation; do not automatically retry an
uncertain submission. Inspect the music management entry before any recovery.
`test_shipinhao_music_readiness.py` covers pending uploads, asynchronous validation,
missing cover/agreement, unknown forms and explicit confirmation.

LazyEdit now includes `source_url` in the actual uploaded package, not only its
tracking database. The publisher selects prior publication truthfully and fills
the newly revealed external playback URL field. Do not strip corrected Japanese
lyrics or translate them into Chinese to work around a form problem.

## Tests and Deployment

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_published_retention.py'` and
the analogous `test_browser_asset_cache.py`. Retention tests cover partial
failures/retries, active jobs, source paths, changed files, unknown evidence,
test/shared packages, symlinks and idempotency.

With Playwright installed, also run `test_shipinhao_music_dropdown.py` and
`test_browser_asset_cache_worker.py`. These exercise asynchronous menu toggling,
selection readback, and an actual dedicated worker fetching a pinned dependency.

Deploy only after the queue is idle. Preserve receipts before an old
non-journaled process restarts. Retry failed platforms only, never all targets.
`AUTOPUBLISH_AUTORELOAD` now defaults to `0`: even a source-only `git pull`
could otherwise interrupt an in-flight music form. Enable it only for local
development without real publishing. The interrupted attempt is retained as
failed/unknown by the journal, never silently replayed.
